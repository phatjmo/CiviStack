# Docker-Compose stack for Wordpress with CiviCRM

`docker-compose up` in this folder should build a local dev environment.

Once up, you'll need to do the following in order to complete the Civi Install:
* Navigate to the WP Admin via your docker host IP address (i.e, http://192.168.99.100/wp-admin)
* Activate the Civi Plugin in the plugins manager.
* Click on the "CiviCRM Installer" link on the toolbar.
* Click on the "Install Civi..." button on that page (or whatever it says)
